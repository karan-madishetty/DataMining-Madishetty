### What is Spatial Transformer Network?

Spatial Transformer Network (STN) is a differentiable module that can be inserted anywhere in ConvNet(CNN's) architecture to increase its geometric invariance. It effectively gives the network the ability to spatially transform _(Operations Such as Scaling, Rotation)_ feature maps at no extra data or supervision cost.

### What are the three key features of STN that solves the issues of Convolutional Networks?
The Spatial Transformer mechanism addresses the issues by providing Convolutional Neural Networks with explicit spatial transformation capabilities. It possesses 3 defining properties that make it very appealing.

### Modular: 
STNs can be inserted anywhere into existing architectures with relatively small tweaking.

### Differentiable: 

STNs can be trained with backprop allowing for end-to-end training of the models they are injected in.

### Dynamic:

 STNs perform active spatial transformation on a feature map for each input sample as compared to the pooling layer which acted identically for all input samples.

### What are the three components of STN?

## Localization network: 
_(General Def)It will estimate which are the best parameters given the input data should be applied to this transformation_


Takes the feature map as input and outputs the parameters of the affine transformation that should be applied to that feature map.

## Grid generator: 
_(General Def)It Basically defines what kind of transformation to be applied_

Generates a grid of (x,y) coordinates using the parameters of the affine transformation that corresponds to a set of points where the input feature map should be sampled to produce the transformed output feature map.

## Sampler: 
_(General Def) It Does Some operations that will solve this problem with the values that are not defined.After Transformations are done the resultant feature map is gone through this phase to take the errors out of the input feature map_

Takes as input the input feature map and the grid generated by the grid generator and produces the output feature map using bilinear interpolation.

### Goal of Spatial Transformer networks

The goal of spatial transformers is to add to your base network a layer able to perform an explicit geometric transformation on an input. The parameters of the transformation are learnt thanks to the standard backpropagation algorithm, meaning there is no need for extra data or supervision.

### Affine Transformation
An affine transformation is any transformation that preserves collinearity (i.e., all points lying on a line initially still lie on a line after transformation) and ratios of distances (e.g., the midpoint of a line segment remains the midpoint after transformation)

### MNIST
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

### BackPropagation
Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate the error contribution of each neuron after a batch of data (in image recognition, multiple images) is processed. It is a special case of an older and more general technique called automatic differentiation.
